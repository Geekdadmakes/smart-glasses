## Switching Personalities

To change personality, edit `config/config.yaml`:

```

Then restart the application.

2. **Voice matters**: Each personality has a matched voice profile
3. **Context carries**: Once you've had a conversation, the personality remains consistent
4. **Preferences work across personalities**: Saved preferences persist even if you change personalities

Each personality has:
- **Tone**: Overall communication style
