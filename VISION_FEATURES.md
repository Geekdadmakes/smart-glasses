# Computer Vision Features - IMPLEMENTED! üëÅÔ∏è

## Overview

Your smart glasses can now **SEE and understand what you're looking at** using Claude's advanced vision capabilities!

This is exactly like Meta AI in Ray-Ban Meta glasses - you can ask your glasses to describe what you see, read text, identify objects, and more.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented

### 1. Scene Description (`look_at` tool)
**Ask questions about what you're seeing:**
- "What am I looking at?"
- "Describe what you see"
- "What's in front of me?"
- "Tell me about this scene"
- "What color is this?"
- "How many people do you see?"

**How it works:**
1. You ask a visual question
2. Camera captures what you're looking at
3. Claude analyzes the image
4. AI describes the scene naturally

### 2. Text Reading (`read_text` tool)
**Read signs, menus, documents, labels:**
- "Read this"
- "What does this say?"
- "Read this menu"
- "What's on this sign?"
- "Read the ingredients"

**How it works:**
1. You ask to read something
2. Camera captures the text
3. Claude performs OCR (optical character recognition)
4. AI reads the text aloud

### 3. Object Identification (`identify_object` tool)
**Identify objects and get information:**
- "What is this?"
- "Identify this object"
- "What am I holding?"
- "What kind of plant is this?"
- "What model is this?"

**How it works:**
1. You ask about an object
2. Camera captures the object
3. Claude identifies it
4. AI provides details and information

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Restaurant Menu
```
You: "Read this menu"
*Camera captures menu*
AI: "The menu shows:
     - Caesar Salad - $12
     - Margherita Pizza - $18
     - Grilled Salmon - $24
     - Chocolate Cake - $8"
```

### Example 2: Describe Scene
```
You: "What do you see?"
*Camera captures scene*
AI: "I see a modern coffee shop with wooden tables,
     about 5 people working on laptops, large windows
     with natural light, and a barista making coffee
     at the counter."
```

### Example 3: Identify Object
```
You: "What is this?"
*Camera captures unknown object*
AI: "This is a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a small single-board
     computer. It's the same microcontroller that's
     powering these smart glasses!"
```

### Example 4: Read Sign
```
You: "What does that sign say?"
*Camera captures street sign*
AI: "The sign says 'Main Street' with an arrow pointing
     left, and below it 'Parking 2 blocks ahead'."
```

### Example 5: Specific Question
```
You: "What color is this shirt?"
*Camera captures shirt*
AI: "The shirt is navy blue with thin white stripes."
```

### Example 6: Count Objects
```
You: "How many bottles are on the table?"
*Camera captures table*
AI: "I can see 3 water bottles on the table."
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Getting Best Results

**1. Good Lighting**
- Natural light works best
- Avoid backlighting
- Indoor lighting is usually fine

**2. Steady Camera**
- Hold head still for a moment
- Let camera focus
- Avoid motion blur

**3. Clear View**
- Point directly at subject
- Get close enough for details
- Avoid obstructions

**4. Specific Questions**
- "What color is this?" (specific)
- Better than "Tell me about this" (vague)

**5. Context Helps**
- "What's on this restaurant menu?"
- Better than just "Read this"

### Question Phrasing

**Scene Description:**
- ‚úÖ "Describe what you see"
- ‚úÖ "What's in this room?"
- ‚úÖ "What am I looking at?"

**Text Reading:**
- ‚úÖ "Read this sign"
- ‚úÖ "What does this say?"
- ‚úÖ "Read the menu"

**Object ID:**
- ‚úÖ "What is this object?"
- ‚úÖ "Identify this plant"
- ‚úÖ "What model is this car?"

**Specific Questions:**
- ‚úÖ "How many people are here?"
- ‚úÖ "What color is this?"

## üì± Example Conversations

### At a Restaurant
```
You: "Hey Jarvis, what's on the menu?"
*Takes photo of menu*
Jarvis: "The menu features Italian cuisine, sir.
         I see pasta dishes ranging from $14-22,
         wood-fired pizzas at $16-20, and
         several seafood options including
         grilled branzino at $28."

You: "What do you recommend?"
Jarvis: "Based on the selections, the Margherita
         pizza appears quite popular - it's
         highlighted on the menu. The daily
         special is linguine with clams at $24."
```

### Shopping
```
You: "What is this?"
*Looking at plant*
AI: "This is a succulent plant, specifically
     it appears to be an Echeveria. These are
     easy to care for and need minimal water."

You: "How do I care for it?"
AI: "Succulents like this need bright indirect
     light and watering only when the soil is
     completely dry, typically every 2-3 weeks."
```

### Navigation
```
You: "Read that sign"
*Looking at street sign*
AI: "The sign says 'Market Street' with a
     left-pointing arrow, and below it says
     'Downtown 0.5 miles'."

You: "Which way is downtown?"
AI: "Based on the sign, downtown is to the
     left, about half a mile away."
```
